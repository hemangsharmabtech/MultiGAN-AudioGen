# MultiGAN-AudioGen
MultiGAN-AudioGen is a deep learning project that combines CycleGAN, MelGAN, VQ-VAE, and VanillaGAN to generate and transform audio. It processes raw audio into spectrograms, learns latent representations, and synthesizes new audio using GANs, enabling realistic audio reconstruction and style transfer.
